/* Algorithm  */
Step 1:

%%%%create the 4 file using the 'touch' command%%%%

touch algorithm.txt bangalore.png code.sh pune.jpeg

Step 2:

*****In the code.sh file*******

%%%'backup-photos'%%%%%
Create folder named 'backup-photos' using the mkdir command.
Check if folder is already exists or not
if exits
	then remove it using the rm command
	then Create folder named 'backup-photos' using the mkdir command


step 3:

%% Filter the png Files from all-files %%
Using the For loop get the png file.
Get the file name using the awk command.
Create the folder within the 'backup-photos' folder created in the step 2, and keep it name as the file name
Get the file extension name using the awk command.
Create the folder within the 'backup-photos/fileName' folder created above, and keep it name as the file extension name.
Now move that png file into the 'backup-photos/fileName/fileExtensionName' folder created above.
**bangalore/ ->png/-> bangalore.png**


Step 4:

%%Filter the jpeg Files from all-files %%
Using the For loop get the jpeg file.
Get the file name using the awk command.
Create the folder within the 'backup-photos' folder created in the step 2, and keep it name as the file name
Get the file extension name using the awk command.
Create the folder within the 'backup-photos/fileName' folder created above, and keep it name as the file extension name.
Now move that png file into the 'backup-photos/fileName/fileExtensionName' folder created above.
**pune/ -> jpeg/ -> pune.jpeg**

Step 5:
Test the code
**base code.sh**
